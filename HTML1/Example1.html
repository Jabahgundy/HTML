    <h1>"The Seven Ravens"</h1>
    <h2>Chapter One</h2>
    <p1> There was once a man who had seven sons, and still he had
        no daughter, however much he wished for one. At length his
        wife again gave him hope of a child, and when it came into
        the world it was a girl. The joy was great, but the child was
        sickly and small, and had to be privately baptized on account of
        its weakness. The father sent one of the boys in haste to the
        spring to fetch water for the baptism. The other six went with
        him, and as each of them wanted to be first to fill it, the jug
        fell into the well. There they stood and did not know what to do,
        and none of them dared to go home. As they still did not return,
        the father grew impatient, and said, they have certainly forgotten
        it while playing some game, the wicked boys. He became afraid that
        the girl would have to die without being baptized, and in his
        anger cried, I wish the boys were all turned into ravens. Hardly
        was the word spoken before he heard a whirring of wings over his
        head, looked up and saw seven coal-black ravens flying away.</p1>

    <h2>Chapter Two</h2>
    <p2> The parents could not withdraw the curse, and however sad they
        were at the loss of their seven sons, they still to some extent
        comforted themselves with their dear little daughter, who soon
        grew strong and every day became more beautiful. For a long time
        she did not know that she had had brothers, for her parents were
        careful not to mention them before her, but one day she
        accidentally heard some people saying of herself, that the girl was
        certainly beautiful, but that in reality she was to blame for the
        misfortune which had befallen her seven brothers. Then she was much
        troubled, and went to her father and mother and asked if it was
        true that she had had brothers, and what had become of them. The
        parents now dared keep the secret no longer, but said that what
        had befallen her brothers was the will of heaven, and that her
        birth had only been the innocent cause. But the maiden took it to
        heart daily, and thought she must save her brothers. She had no
        rest or peace until she set out secretly, and went forth into the
        wide world to search for her brothers and set them free, let it
        cost what it might. She took nothing with her but a little ring
        belonging to her parents as a keepsake, a loaf of bread against
        hunger, a little pitcher of water against thirst, and a little
        chair as a provision against weariness.</p2>
