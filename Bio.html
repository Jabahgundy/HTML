    <h2>I am who I am</h2>

    <p>Hey, again my name is Jabah Gundy, and you all can call me <u>Jay</u> for short.
        I was born and raised in the Bronx, New York City. Growing up there,
        some days was perfect, and some were rough. In a nutshell, I had to become a man early.
        Ultimately, I am glad I had the opportunity to move to a different state,
        which helped me slow down and focus on what I wanted for myself.</p>

    <p>One day I was watching a movie about a guy who mistakingly creates a
        program with the intent of helping law enforcement stop crime. However,
        the program came to life and began to terrorize the city. Long story short,
        the program was deleted, and the city was saved. That is when I fell in
        love with computers. I wanted to know more about computers, so I joined
        the military to jumpstart my career and became a 25 Bravo Information
        Technology Specialist. Now, I am here studying how to code.
        Thank you for reading.</p>
